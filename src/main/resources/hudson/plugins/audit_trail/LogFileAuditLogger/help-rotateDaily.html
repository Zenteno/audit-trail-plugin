    Rotate the logs daily according to the time configured in the System. The FileHandler will be configured with
    limit=0 (unlimited size) and count=1 so that it does not produce more than 1 file per day. Thus the value
    configured in <i>%Log File Size MB</i> will not be considered and the <i>%Log file Count</i> will be used to
    limit the number of files created in the file system.
